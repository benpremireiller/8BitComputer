# 8-bit Computer Project

This repository contains information about a custom-built 8-bit breadboard computer. The computer is designed to execute a set of basic instructions and demonstrates fundamental concepts of computer architecture.

## Architecture Overview

This computer features an 8-bit architecture and includes two general-purpose registers, an instruction register, a program counter, an ALU capable of addition and subtraction, 16 bytes of latchable memory, and a digital LED display that outputs numbers in decimal.

## Op Codes

| Op Code (Binary) | Instruction | Description                          |
|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0000 xxxx        | NOP         | No Operation                         |
| 0001 xxxx        | MOVA        | Move MEM To Accumulator              |
| 0010 xxxx        | MOVI        | Move IMM To Accumulator              |
| 0011 xxxx        | ADD         | Add To Accumulator                   |
| 0100 xxxx        | SUB         | Subtract From Accumulator            |
| 0101 xxxx        | LDA         | Load Accumulator To Memory           |
| 0110 xxxx        | JMP         | Jump To Instruction                  |
| 0111 xxxx        | OUT         | Output Accumulator To Display        |
| 1000 xxxx        | HLT         | Halt Clock                           |

There are 8 empty instruction slots.

## Getting Started

To program the computer, the halt clock control signal should be set high. The user should then manually input the program bits into memory using the 8 blue dipswitches located just below the memory unit. Once a value is ready to be loaded, the user should press the small black button located to the left of the memory unit to latch the values into memory. The program counter should be set to the memory entry point of the program then the program can be executed by setting the halt clock control signal to low.
